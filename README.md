Just a project to keep myself in practice now that I've graduated.  Mainly to keep myself familiar with JavaFX and partially to experiment with other libraries (First time working with XML successfully!)
Primarily I want to make a program I can use when DMing our own sessions, but if it becomes fully featured I may try to show it off some.

##### Implemented:
* Save/load
* Character List
* Basic Initiative

##### To Be Implemented
* Character Detail, updated with Initiative
* Simple edit character functionality
* Add interactivity to Character List (simple damage, add xp, levels)
